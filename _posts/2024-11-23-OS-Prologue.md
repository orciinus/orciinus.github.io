# Prologue

He was used to roaming in search of him. Because he was the type of person to keep his thoughts to himself, draw conclusions however he pleased, place ends before means, and refuse to seek the help of others.
 
“Yeah, this is how you’ve always been.”
 
Kallis gritted his teeth as he scoured the Sierra Forest, the light slowly dimming around him. However, the woods were too vast, and time was slipping away. His heart thumped faster, pulsing with dread.
 
He wanted to set fire to the forest, dry from the winter air, to flush him out. Normally, Kallis would have placed his safety above all else, but right now, he just wanted to have him within his grasp, no matter the means.
 
But he couldn’t. Too many others were after him as well. He had quite the knack for making enemies.
 
Kallis eliminated all pursuers in sight. The man probably wanted to be found first by the enemies he had worked so hard to create, and that was why Kallis would never allow that to happen.
 
Once he found him, once he had him in his grasp, Kallis wanted to lock him deep away, somewhere he couldn’t escape. Like a fool who only ate what he fed him, only looked at what he showed him, and only listened to his voice, unable to act on his own.
 
In any case, he had already made an enemy of the whole country, so maybe that was a better fate for him. Depending on how you looked at it, this situation might even be a good thing. He had brought this upon himself, so he had no one else to blame for it.
 
Before he even knew it, the sun had completely set, and the red haze in the western sky had dissolved into darkness. As the day came to an end, the forest air grew noticeably colder.
 
There was no time to waste. Though he tried to mask it, he was quick to feel the cold. He had to hurry and find him.
 
As the night grew deeper, so did the tension in Kallis, his fingertips reduced to mere trembles. In fact, he hated dark places too. A person like that...
 
“...in a place like this.”
 
Kallis sighed. No matter how dark, no matter how far, he would recognise him in a heartbeat. Just as he always had.
 
Kallis dismounted from his horse and stepped toward him. It hadn’t been his intention to approach in silence, but he found himself unable to breathe.
 
Something was wrong. Sensitive as he was, he should have noticed his presence by now, but the figure remained slumped against the large tree, unmoving. Anxiety gnawed at him, a buzzing sound rising in his ears.
 
The closer Kallis drew, the sharper his fear became. The light blond hair and pale face before him looked no different from usual, but the utter lack of colour made him seem as though he could disappear at any moment. If not for the faint, white breaths that escaped his dry, lifeless lips, intermittently opening for gasps, Kallis would have sunk into despair before even having had the chance to feel relief at having tracked him down at last.
 
Kallis knelt before him, a spark of anger flaring inside him as his eyes took in the scratches on his face, the swollen quality of his lips, the plainness of his broken shoulder, and the abrasions left by the ropes that had once bound him.
 
“Why do you always...”
 
Throw yourself in pain’s way, keep your wounds hidden, and calmly lie whilst carelessly hiding the truth.
 
“Treat yourself like this...”
 
His love for him was unconditional, it truly was, but there was a part of him that couldn’t stand the way things were, that resented him. However, Kallis held neither the right to love nor loathe him, and that fact made him seethe with a mix of chagrin and regret.
 
He had longed to hold him tightly, to never let go when they finally reunited, but now that he sat before his eyes, Kallis found it impossible to even brush him with the tips of his fingers. It was as though, the moment his hand made contact, he would vanish like smoke, like some fleeting illusion.
 
The horrid thoughts that swirled in his mind never aligned with his actions. Each time, his guilt overshadowed his desire. After a long, agonising pause, Kallis carefully extended his hand. It took a moment longer for his trembling fingertips to finally brush against his cheek.
 
When his fingers finally made contact, his eyelids slowly fluttered open. Blue eyes stared straight at Kallis.
 
Naturally, Kallis expected him to grow angry, to laugh at him, and to ignore him, just as he did before. However, impossible as it seemed, he actually...
 
Lideryle’s eyes soon fluttered shut, cutting off any chance of reading the emotions that had been lingering in those blue depths.
