Prince Lideryle, the fourth heir to the throne of Vernya, is a man with little more than a pretty face and a vile personality.
Lacking both the ambition and the influence to claim the throne, he drifts through life in indulgence and debauchery, but…


“My wish is for Lidel-nim to sit above all others.”


Kallis’s fervent whisper echoed in Lideryle’s ear.
Kallis had been the sole person willing to stand by his side since childhood, so to fulfil his wish, Lideryle decides to join the revolution, but…

“Even if you object, I’ll grant your wish the way I see fit.”


**Open season**
